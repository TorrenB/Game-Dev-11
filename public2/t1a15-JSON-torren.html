<h1>Difference Between JSON and JavaScript Files</h1>
<textarea readonly>
Sure! Here’s a version that sounds like it’s written by a 16-year-old with just a few weeks of coding under their belt:

---

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a simple way to format data that’s really easy to read and write. It’s kind of like how people and computers share info without getting mixed up. You often see JSON when a server sends data to a website. Basically, it’s just text, and it works with all sorts of programming languages, like C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, and even Python.

### Here’s the Deal:

1. **Format**:  
   - JSON is just data. JavaScript files are where the actual coding happens to make things work.

2. **Structure**:  
   - JSON organizes stuff in key-value pairs, which is kind of like a list of things. It can handle simple stuff like objects, arrays, strings, and numbers. JavaScript files can do way more than just that, like run functions and control what happens in the code.

3. **Execution**:  
   - JSON can’t have functions or comments—it's just data, so you can’t run it as code. But JavaScript files are meant to be run, so they can control the webpage, respond to clicks, and do all the cool logic stuff.

4. **File Extension**:  
   - JSON files usually end in .json, while JavaScript files end in .js.

So basically, JSON is for sending and getting data, and JavaScript files are for making websites do things. Pretty cool, right?

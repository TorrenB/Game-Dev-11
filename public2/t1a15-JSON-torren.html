<h1>Difference Between JSON and JavaScript Files</h1>
<textarea readonly>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is typically used for data exchange between a server and a web application. It is a text format that is completely language-independent, but it uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, which includes C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, and Python.

Key Differences:
1. Format:
   - JSON is a data format, while JavaScript files contain executable code.
   
2. Structure:
   - JSON is structured in key-value pairs and can represent simple data structures (objects, arrays, strings, numbers, etc.). JavaScript files can contain functions, control structures, and much more.
   
3. Execution:
   - JSON cannot contain functions or comments and is not executable. JavaScript files are designed to be run and can manipulate the DOM, handle events, and include logic.
   
4. File Extension:
   - JSON files typically have a .json extension, while JavaScript files have a .js extension.

In summary, JSON is used for data interchange, while JavaScript files are used to implement functionality in web applications.

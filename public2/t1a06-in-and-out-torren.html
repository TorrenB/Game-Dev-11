        <p>We're no strangers to love<br>
He was a boy, she was a girl<br>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
He was a punk, she did ballet<br>
What more can I say?<br>
He wanted her<br>
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well<br>
But all of her friends stuck up their nose<br>
They had a problem with his baggy clothes<br>
He was a skater boy<br>
She said see you later boy<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space<br>
She needed to come back down to earth<br>
Five years from now<br>
She sits at home<br>
Feeding the baby she's all alone<br>
She turns on TV<br>
Guess who she sees<br>
Skater boy rockin' up MTV<br>
She calls up her friends<br>
They already know<br><br>
She tags along stands in the crowd<br>
Looks up at the man that she turned down<br>
He was a skater boy<br>
She said see you later boy<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar<br>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
He was a skater boy<br>
She said see you later boy<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar<br>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
Sorry girl but you missed out<br>
Well tough luck that boy's mine now<br>
We are more than just good friends<br>
This is how the story ends<br>
Too bad that you couldn't see<br>
See the man that boy could be<br>
There is more that meets the eye<br>
I see the soul that is inside<br>
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl<br>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
We are in love<br>
Haven't you heard<br>
How we rock each other's world<br>
I'm with the skater boy<br>
I said see you later boy<br>
I'll be back stage after the show<br>
I'll be at the studio<br>
Singing the song we wrote<br>
About a girl you used to know<br>
I'm with the skater boy<br>
I said see you later boy<br>
I'll be back stage after the show<br>
I'll be at the studio<br>
Singing the song we wrote<br>
About a girl you used to know</p><br>
